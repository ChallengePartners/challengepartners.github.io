# ChallengePartners


For this hackathon we are redesigning the landing page for Challenge Partners.

## The issue
The current landing page offers no clarity on what Challenge Partners does. The website is confusing and too busy

### Wire Frames

We have tried to make the landing page much simpler so that new visitors can understand what the company
does.

### What we did

* We removed many of the menu items
from the front page
* removed a lot of content from the front page
* added a footer
* We have included a 'What we do section' on the front page which summarizes the Challenge Partners
* added sections for events/ programmes as this is what people would be most interested in.
*  


### Stretch Goals

* a how we do it diagram - an explanation of the hub model referenced in the 'what we do' section
